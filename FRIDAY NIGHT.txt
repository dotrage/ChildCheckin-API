- Problem: Nashville Metro schools have a problem with child attendance... not the students who attend but those who don't show up for class.
- Solution:
		- Child Check In: then notifying parents accordingly that the child didn't show up (SMS, email, automated call)
	- monetization: Parent-Teacher Associations could pay for it
	- Competition: Google: chancery public schools attendance
	- additional ideas: gamification (encourage kids to attend class, reward attendance with merit)
